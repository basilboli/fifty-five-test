fifty-five-test
===============

Little proof-of-concept with tree structures demaned by 55:
generating simple tree structure of questions using
custom tree (MyTreeNode.java) and gwt framework.

Classes
===

* MyTreeNode  - main tree structure
* Node - node used by MyTreeNode
* QuestionGenerator  - mock class for questions

* TreeTest  - main test

etc.

Run
====
ant devmode

Important Notes
===
* Application is generated using gwt webCreate for speed reasons. Some boilerplate code maybe still there.

* (Reinventing the wheel).Implementation of the custom version of the Tree was considered as a part of challange. Of cource I know about javax.swing.tree TreeNode etc.
